**Chart -** type  bar chart

5. Fat content by outlet for total sales
   
**Objective:** compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content
**Additional KPI Metrics:** assess how other KPIs (Average sales, number of items, average rating) vary with fat content.
**Chart type –** stacked column chart

7. Total sales by outlet establishment
   
**Objective:** evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
**Chart type –** line chart

9.	Sales by outlet size
    
**Objective:** analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales
**Chart type –** dount/pie chart

**Objective:** assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
**Chart type-** funnel map

13.	All metrics by outlet type
    
**Objective:** provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (total sales, average sales, number of items, average ratings) broken by different outlet types.
**Chart types –** matrix cards

## Steps Taken
# step-by-step process for creating the dashboard you described:

**1. Import Data:** Load the dataset into Power BI. Ensure the data is clean and well-structured.

**2. Define KPIs:** Create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using DAX formulas to calculate metrics such as:
- Total Sales
-Average Sales
- Number of Items Sold
- Average Rating

**3. Build Visuals Based on Requirements:**
- Use a Donut Chart to display Total Sales by FAT Content.
- Use a Bar Chart or similar visuals to show metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) impacted by FAT Content, Outlets, and Item Types.

**4. Create a Dynamic Parameter:**
- Develop a parameter to dynamically switch between metrics (e.g., Total Sales, Average Sales, etc.) and apply it to your visuals to allow interactive comparisons.

**5. Format for Interactivity:**
- Add a Tile Format to display Average Ratings more prominently.
- Ensure visuals interact with each other (e.g., clicking on one visual updates the rest).

**6. Sales by Outlet Analysis:** 
- Create visuals showing sales trends based on outlet establishment, location, outlet size, and type. Use matrices and highlights for better data interpretation.

**7. Add Slicers:**
- Enhance user interactivity by adding slicers for key dimensions like FAT Content, Outlet Type, and Item Type to filter the data dynamically.

**8. Finalize and Review:**
- Format the dashboard for a polished look, ensuring it aligns with the business requirements and provides actionable insights.
